# docker-scripts
Just some small simple scripts I made to make my life easier.

## restart.sh
It is an extremely simple shell script that restarts any specific docker-compose container(s). Ensure the script is in the same directory as your *docker-compose.yml* file.
```
./restart.sh <containerName1> <containerName2> <containerNameN>
```
